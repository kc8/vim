# NOTES
This is a basic setup for using C/C++ and C# (which needs a little attention)

Currently most settings geared towards NVim and NVimQT. I did not 
include the ginit.vim as it needs some help. 

# VIM

# NEOVIM 

# TODO
- [ ] Finish the windows_setup.bat. Add, automatic setup to add init.vim into 
correct directory. Add Plugin Install. See if I can automate YCM
